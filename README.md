I recently changed how I do my note taking and what app I use. The previous app was great and had an extension for clipping web pages, but I kept running into issues with losing notes.

This python script is a simple clipping script that performs nearly the same functionality.

- Provide the name of a directory to save notes to, relative to the `base_clip_dir`
- Provide URL to be clipped
- Provide any tags to include for the clipped page (added as YAML at top of `.md` document)

More changes will come; it is inconsistent currently in clipping images.
